to check 2 strings such that one is subsequence of other .the logic heere used is that we are checking that the subsequence string characters are in the same order in the main string
.we check it by considering 2 indices i and count. i checks the length of entire main string and count caculates the length of characters both found in mainstring and substring.If the final count matches with the length of subsequqence then it is a complete match.



now what is a subsequence?
actually speaking it is a substring with missing characters.

include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


string findSubSeq(string main,string sub){
 int i=0,count=0;
 int msize=main.size();
 int ssize=sub.size();
 
 while(i<msize && count<ssize){
  if (main[i]==sub[count])count++;
  i++;
  }
 
 if(ssize==count)return "Match Found";
 
 return "Not Found";
}

int main(){
 
 string main,sub;
 getline(cin,main);
 getline(cin,sub);

 string result = findSubSeq(main,sub);
 cout<<result<<"\n";
 return 0;
}
